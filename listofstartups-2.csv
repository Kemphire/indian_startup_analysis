In the organised income sector there are different ways of recognising Financial Identity of a person through his salaried employment, ITR and other financial instruments to validate his creditworthiness. But this is not true for the unorganized income sector, say for a maid, electrician, Plumber etc. where they do not have an instrument to show their financial identity and thus the creditworthiness. Because of this they are deprived of many of the schemes of financial assistance from government. 

The problem will be resolved through a Deeptech platform (AI) and through an organised field force collating and verifying field data. The details of the beneficiary is taken in different headings like, the personal information, Acquaintances, Bank details, Loan details , Income , Skill set, Proof of assets, Family details , Expenditure details , Health information , and social contacts

The very need for such methods of learning emerges from the sole textbook explanations without providing any graphical/animated representations. This piece of work started with just a small idea, but because of the involvement of many peopleï¿½s effort in developing, it took the shape of a book. This book fundamentally uses the technology called Augmented Reality, where virtual objects are get placed or projected virtually into the real world using a digital device like a phone, tablet or any other compatible devices. A better understanding can be provided using such virtual projections without any practical/real implications on the subject areas. The technology has been in use in many sectors, predominantly designs, where the use of such means makes the process very efficient. Similarly, it could be used in educational sector where learning can become more fun and practical Every sector in India has seen great innovations in last few decades where technologies have played a vital role in upgrading the services and respective processes. However, the educational institutions and schools in India are yet to incorporate these technological advances which have potential use in this sector. Few new innovative techniques of learning were introduced in the sector like SmartBoards, which are still confined to a handful of schools (of any order) throughout the nation. Thus, it was one of our objectives to make it available to as many students as possible irrespective of their school, economic status, and location. It is user-friendly for an elementary student requiring the basic knowledge for operating any compatible electronic device, and possibilities for development and innovations with this tool by students itself is boundless. A three-dimensional representation of various elements in addition to two-dimensional representation and text explanation will allow students to understand without doubts. Such an application of the technology would increase the imagination power of students or anyone using the tool. The tool allows for a number of users at the same time, contrary to Smart-Boards where a tutor has control over visualization. We are making huge effort to make the education much more entertaining, elaborative, interesting and easy to comprehend. In the coming days, there are more Books coming on the way, based on a different subject like Historical buildings, Biology, Medical procedures etc. We believe you will love our effort and work we have put in and We will appreciate your support.

Visually Impaired people have very restricted use of cell phones. as one would prefer a quick chat rather than a voice call.
The Biggest problem a visually Impaired person faces while attending a phone call is that they Should carry bulky devices or arrange ear peace or hang wire around the neck which is very inconvenient for them. As they get major input from ears they donï¿½t wanna block it. So to overcome all this pain and to ease the way of communication and Add them up to create better communication for both worlds. 

We are introducing smart ring a communicational device by which you can access, phone calls, text messages, and many others.
The beauty of over product is that it works on the unique combinations of BCT as well as IoT. When you place a smart ring on the finger, the mechanical waves are produced by a smart ring pass to the bone cavity and bone nerve and when you place the finger to the ear the mechanical waves follow through our auditory system and produce sound waves. In simple words, there are no inbuilt speakers in it we with our technology to make the fingertip as a speaker. And make it possible to accesses everything. 
Which makes our product is more secure to use, as fewer chances of losing it, and almost no dropping of phone or product. Less radiation while comparing to mobile. Easy to access phone calls, text messages, navigation, text to speech, speech to text and can control the phone via commands.""",every innovation pain point let start visually impaired people restricted use cell phones one would prefer quick chat rather voice call biggest problem visually impaired person faces attending phone call carry bulky devices arrange ear peace hang wire around neck inconvenient get major input ears wan na block overcome pain ease way communication add create better communication worlds introducing smart ring communicational device access phone calls text messages many others beauty product works unique combinations bct well iot place smart ring finger mechanical waves produced smart ring pass bone cavity bone nerve place finger ear mechanical waves follow auditory system produce sound waves simple words inbuilt speakers technology make fingertip speaker make possible accesses everything makes product secure use fewer chances losing almost dropping phone product less radiation comparing mobile easy access phone calls text messages navigation text speech speech text control phone via commands

Whenever a person purchases a product, the product will be registered on his/her mobile number. So all the products in his/her home will be listed in the application. 

When the customer logs in: 
- He/She can track their products warranty period 
- Can access digital invoices of products 
- View FAQ, OEM Terms for warranty 
- Get Contact, Location details of OEM 
- Push Notifications will be delivered to customers as the warranty period of a product is about to expire. 

And If any product malfunctions, by the click of a button, We will forward the warranty request directly to the OEM if under warranty or forward the insurance request to the Insurer if itï¿½s an insurance case.
Without WarrantyMe, the customer has to find the invoice, look for the service centre, visit the location, wait for the slot and has to get the service done, and for insurance itï¿½s the same.
