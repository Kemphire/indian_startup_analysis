In the organised income sector there are different ways of recognising Financial Identity of a person through his salaried employment, ITR and other financial instruments to validate his creditworthiness. But this is not true for the unorganized income sector, say for a maid, electrician, Plumber etc. where they do not have an instrument to show their financial identity and thus the creditworthiness. Because of this they are deprived of many of the schemes of financial assistance from government. 

The problem will be resolved through a Deeptech platform (AI) and through an organised field force collating and verifying field data. The details of the beneficiary is taken in different headings like, the personal information, Acquaintances, Bank details, Loan details , Income , Skill set, Proof of assets, Family details , Expenditure details , Health information , and social contacts

Such patients regularly face some abnormalities in their health and regularly face some minor doubts related to their diet, medications, values in reports, side effects, other abnormal symptoms, etc. It is not always possible, easy, and financially viable to pay (800-2000 INR) to book an appointment, travel (2-3 Hrs) to hospital, and wait for (3-4 Hrs) in the hospital to meet the doctor to clarify a small doubt. In such scenarios, if the patients are little web techie, they try to search for some related posts on google. Such posts are generally tricky to find, and they do not directly address the specific concern. If they are not comfortable with technology, they simply keep tolerating the issue until the next appointment or keep trying their own remedies.

The very need for such methods of learning emerges from the sole textbook explanations without providing any graphical/animated representations. This piece of work started with just a small idea, but because of the involvement of many peopleÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s effort in developing, it took the shape of a book. This book fundamentally uses the technology called Augmented Reality, where virtual objects are get placed or projected virtually into the real world using a digital device like a phone, tablet or any other compatible devices. A better understanding can be provided using such virtual projections without any practical/real implications on the subject areas. The technology has been in use in many sectors, predominantly designs, where the use of such means makes the process very efficient. Similarly, it could be used in educational sector where learning can become more fun and practical Every sector in India has seen great innovations in last few decades where technologies have played a vital role in upgrading the services and respective processes. However, the educational institutions and schools in India are yet to incorporate these technological advances which have potential use in this sector. Few new innovative techniques of learning were introduced in the sector like SmartBoards, which are still confined to a handful of schools (of any order) throughout the nation. Thus, it was one of our objectives to make it available to as many students as possible irrespective of their school, economic status, and location. It is user-friendly for an elementary student requiring the basic knowledge for operating any compatible electronic device, and possibilities for development and innovations with this tool by students itself is boundless. A three-dimensional representation of various elements in addition to two-dimensional representation and text explanation will allow students to understand without doubts. Such an application of the technology would increase the imagination power of students or anyone using the tool. The tool allows for a number of users at the same time, contrary to Smart-Boards where a tutor has control over visualization. We are making huge effort to make the education much more entertaining, elaborative, interesting and easy to comprehend. In the coming days, there are more Books coming on the way, based on a different subject like Historical buildings, Biology, Medical procedures etc. We believe you will love our effort and work we have put in and We will appreciate your support.

The company is in the business of carrying on the research, development, planning, engineering and construction of Renewable Energy Projects.

We offer the state-of-the-art design of our patent-pending mechanism which extracts energy in a radically different way from the low-velocity wind. Using highly-efficient permanent magnet alternators, our disc turbine can work in the most predominant wind conditions, extricating its potential. 

It can produce comparatively higher power at wind speeds of 8 m/s. Our solution also includes a complete plug and play system with a storage and inverter facility which makes it user-friendly and much convenient for installation as compared to other products in the market. Moreover, it integrates both wind & solar energy which makes it a reliable and continuous source of energy.
The product is for people in the rural as well as the urban areas that lack or have no reliable source of power. It is also for those who are looking to rely on renewable as an alternate source of power for their establishments.

So to overcome all this pain and to ease the way of communication and Add them up to create better communication for both worlds. 

We are introducing smart ring a communicational device by which you can access, phone calls, text messages, and many others.
The beauty of over product is that it works on the unique combinations of BCT as well as IoT. When you place a smart ring on the finger, the mechanical waves are produced by a smart ring pass to the bone cavity and bone nerve and when you place the finger to the ear the mechanical waves follow through our auditory system and produce sound waves. In simple words, there are no inbuilt speakers in it we with our technology to make the fingertip as a speaker. And make it possible to accesses everything.

Lack of cold storage leads to an annual loss of more than INR 100,000 crore of fresh fruits and vegetables in our country. It also directly reduces farmer incomes. Temperate cold rooms are based on an innovative energy-efficient cooling technology called dew point cooling. The technology helps in lowering the number of solar panels required for powering the cooling system, which reduces the overall cost of the off-grid cold store. We have filed three patent applications on the technology. We are currently prototyping cold storage solutions in different form factors.

Today, If we go and buy an electronic device at a store they give us a physical copy of the invoice or email it to us, same goes for device insurance purchases. 
By Partnering with electronic retail stores we are registering/onboarding all consumer electronic purchases of a person like their Mobiles, TV'S, Refrigerator's....into the app, we digitise the bill, save the product details and then provide the after sale services like warranty/repair through our app. 
Whenever a person purchases a product, the product will be registered on his/her mobile number. So all the products in his/her home will be listed in the application. 

When the customer logs in: 
- He/She can track their products warranty period 
- Can access digital invoices of products 
- View FAQ, OEM Terms for warranty 
- Get Contact, Location details of OEM 
- Push Notifications will be delivered to customers as the warranty period of a product is about to expire. 

And If any product malfunctions, by the click of a button, We will forward the warranty request directly to the OEM if under warranty or forward the insurance request to the Insurer if itÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s an insurance case.
Without WarrantyMe, the customer has to find the invoice, look for the service centre, visit the location, wait for the slot and has to get the service done, and for insurance itÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s the same.
